Many countries implemented contact tracing systems to track and trace individual infected with the coronavirus (COVID-19). However, the majority are facing privacy implications and inaccurate proximity estimation. Meanwhile, governments try to minimise the impact on student education, but low engagement inspected due to limited in-person interaction. Pupils and staff are concerned about returning to campus as challenges in social distancing within the confined classroom during high infectious rate. 

This project developed QMSafe, a contact tracing application for a campus environment based on a student attendance system. Geolocation used to take student attendance and identify users who may have exposed to COVID-19. Whenever users reported experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or diagnosed positive, close contact users will receive self-isolation notification, so they do not come on campus. 

Through user testing, this project observed that university-based contact tracing provides a secure academic environment, and along with the student attendance system, accommodates to encourage students to attend classes.

In this zip file, it contains all the code for my application QMSafe.  Along with the attempted BLE implementations.

Command to run QMSafe:

1. npm install
2. react-native run-ios
